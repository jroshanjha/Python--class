# Python Interview Questions and Answers

## Basic Python Interview Questions

1. **Q: What is Python? What are its key features?**

   A: Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Key features include:
   - Easy to learn and read due to its simple syntax
   - Interpreted language, which allows for dynamic typing
   - Object-oriented programming support
   - Extensive standard library
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Strong community support and numerous third-party packages

2. **Q: Explain the difference between lists and tuples in Python.**

   A: Lists and tuples are both sequence data types in Python, but they have some key differences:
   - Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation), while tuples are immutable
   - Lists use square brackets `[]`, tuples use parentheses `()`
   - Lists generally consume more memory than tuples
   - Tuples are faster for accessing elements

   Example:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple
   
   my_list[0] = 4  # Valid
   my_tuple[0] = 4  # Raises TypeError
   ```

3. **Q: How do you comment code in Python?**

   A: Python supports single-line and multi-line comments:
   - Single-line comments start with `#`
   - Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes `'''` or `"""`

   Example:
   ```python
   # This is a single-line comment

   '''
   This is a
   multi-line comment
   '''
   ```

4. **Q: What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators?**

   A: 
   - `==` compares the value or equality of two objects
   - `is` checks if two variables point to the same object in memory

   Example:
   ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   b = [1, 2, 3]
   c = a

   print(a == b)  # True (same value)
   print(a is b)  # False (different objects)
   print(a is c)  # True (same object)
   ```

5. **Q: Explain the use of the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' idiom.**

   A: This idiom is used to check whether a Python script is being run directly or being imported as a module. 
   The code inside this block only runs if the script is the main program.

   Example:
   ```python
   def main():
       print("This is the main function")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

## Intermediate Python Interview Questions

6. **Q: What are list comprehensions? Provide an example.**

   A: List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
   print(squares)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
   ```

7. **Q: Explain the difference between deep copy and shallow copy.**

   A: 
   - Shallow copy creates a new object but references the same memory addresses for nested objects
   - Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects

   Example:
   ```python
   import copy

   original = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
   shallow = copy.copy(original)
   deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

   original[0][0] = 9
   print(shallow)  # [[9, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
   print(deep)     # [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
   ```

8. **Q: What are decorators in Python? Give an example.**

   A: Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or classes without directly changing their source code.

   Example:
   ```python
   def uppercase_decorator(func):
       def wrapper():
           result = func()
           return result.upper()
       return wrapper

   @uppercase_decorator
   def greet():
       return "hello, world"

   print(greet())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD
   ```

9. **Q: How does exception handling work in Python?**

   A: Exception handling in Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks:
   - `try`: Contains code that might raise an exception
   - `except`: Handles specific exceptions
   - `else`: Executed if no exception occurs in the try block
   - `finally`: Always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred

   Example:
   ```python
   try:
       result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero")
   else:
       print("Division successful")
   finally:
       print("This always executes")
   ```

10. **Q: What is the difference between a module and a package in Python?**

    A: 
    - A module is a single Python file containing reusable code
    - A package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional `__init__.py` file
    
    Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace.

## Advanced Python Interview Questions

11. **Q: Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.**

    A: The GIL is a mutex (lock) that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. 
    This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe. While it ensures thread safety, 
    it can become a bottleneck in CPU-bound and multi-threaded code.

12. **Q: What are metaclasses in Python?**

    A: Metaclasses are classes for classes. 
    They define how a class behaves. The most common use case is to automatically modify the class definition at the time it's created.

    Example:
    ```python
    class Meta(type):
        def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
            dct['additional_method'] = lambda self: print("This method was added by the metaclass")
            return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

    class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
        pass

    obj = MyClass()
    obj.additional_method()  # Output: This method was added by the metaclass
    ```

13. **Q: How does memory management work in Python?**

    A: Python uses a combination of reference counting and garbage collection for memory management:
    - Reference counting: Python keeps track of the number of references to each object
    - Garbage collection: Detects and frees memory from unreferenced objects
    - Python also uses a private heap to store all objects and data structures

14. **Q: Explain the concept of generators and their advantages.**

    A: Generators are functions that return an iterator. They generate items one at a time and only when asked, making them memory efficient for representing large sequences.

    Advantages:
    - Memory Efficient: They don't store all items in memory
    - Lazy Evaluation: Generate values on-demand
    - Represent Infinite Sequences

    Example:
    ```python
    def fibonacci():
        a, b = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

    fib = fibonacci()
    for _ in range(5):
        print(next(fib))  # Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
    ```

15. **Q: What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ methods?**

    A: 
    - `__getattr__` is called when an attribute is not found in the usual places (instance's dictionary, class's dictionary, base classes)
    - `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute access, even before looking at the actual attributes on the object

    Example:
    ```python
    class A:
        def __getattr__(self, name):
            return f"Attribute '{name}' not found"

    class B:
        def __getattribute__(self, name):
            return f"Accessing '{name}'"

    a = A()
    b = B()

    print(a.exists)  # Output: Attribute 'exists' not found
    print(b.exists)  # Output: Accessing 'exists'
    ```

These questions and answers cover a range of Python concepts from basic to advanced. They provide a good starting point for preparing for Python interviews or reviewing key Python concepts.

# Additional Python Interview Questions and Answers

## Basic Python Interview Questions

16. **Q: What are the basic data types in Python?**

    A: Python has several basic data types:
    - Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
    - Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
    - Text Type: `str`
    - Mapping Type: `dict`
    - Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
    - Boolean Type: `bool`
    - Binary Types: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

    Example:
    ```python
    integer = 5
    float_num = 5.0
    complex_num = 3 + 2j
    string = "Hello"
    list_example = [1, 2, 3]
    tuple_example = (1, 2, 3)
    dictionary = {"key": "value"}
    set_example = {1, 2, 3}
    boolean = True
    ```

17. **Q: How do you handle file I/O in Python?**

    A: Python provides several ways to handle file I/O. The most common method is using the `open()` function:

    ```python
    # Writing to a file
    with open('example.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, World!')

    # Reading from a file
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        print(content)
    ```

    The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after operations are completed.

18. **Q: What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` methods of list?**

    A: 
    - `append()` adds a single element to the end of the list
    - `extend()` adds all elements from an iterable to the end of the list

    Example:
    ```python
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list1.append(4)
    print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2.extend([4, 5])
    print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

19. **Q: How do you remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order?**

    A: You can use a dictionary or a set to remove duplicates while preserving the order:

    ```python
    def remove_duplicates(lst):
        seen = set()
        return [x for x in lst if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]

    original = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3]
    result = remove_duplicates(original)
    print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

20. **Q: What is the purpose of the `pass` statement in Python?**

    A: The `pass` statement is a null operation in Python. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required, but no action is desired or needed.

    Example:
    ```python
    def function_not_implemented_yet():
        pass

    class EmptyClass:
        pass
    ```

## Advanced Python Interview Questions

21. **Q: Explain context managers in Python. How do you create one?**

    A: Context managers in Python are used for resource management. 
    They ensure that resources are properly acquired and released. 
    You can create a context manager using the `with` statement or by defining a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

    Example using a class:
    ```python
    class FileManager:
        def __init__(self, filename, mode):
            self.filename = filename
            self.mode = mode
            self.file = None

        def __enter__(self):
            self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
            return self.file

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
            if self.file:
                self.file.close()

    # Usage
    with FileManager('example.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, World!')
    ```

22. **Q: What are Python's magic methods (dunder methods)? Give examples.**

    A: Magic methods, also called dunder (double underscore) methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names. They allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types or implement operator overloading.

    Examples:
    ```python
    class CustomList:
        def __init__(self, items):
            self.items = items

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.items)

        def __getitem__(self, index):
            return self.items[index]

        def __str__(self):
            return f"CustomList({self.items})"

    my_list = CustomList([1, 2, 3])
    print(len(my_list))  # Output: 3
    print(my_list[1])    # Output: 2
    print(my_list)       # Output: CustomList([1, 2, 3])
    ```

23. **Q: How does multithreading differ from multiprocessing in Python?**

    A: 
    - Multithreading: Runs threads concurrently within a single process. Due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), it's more suitable for I/O-bound tasks.
    - Multiprocessing: Runs separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. 
    It's more suitable for CPU-bound tasks and can utilize multiple CPU cores.

    Example of multiprocessing:
    ```python
    from multiprocessing import Pool

    def f(x):
        return x*x

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Pool(5) as p:
            print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))
    ```

24. **Q: Explain the concept of decorators with parameters in Python.**

    A: Decorators with parameters are essentially nested functions. The outermost function takes the parameters, the middle function is the actual decorator, and the innermost function is the wrapper around the decorated function.

    Example:
    ```python
    def repeat(times):
        def decorator(func):
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                for _ in range(times):
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                return result
            return wrapper
        return decorator

    @repeat(3)
    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}")

    greet("Alice")  # Prints "Hello, Alice" three times
    ```

25. **Q: What are Python descriptors and when would you use them?**

    A: Descriptors are objects that define how attribute access on other objects should behave. They implement at least one of the methods `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__`. Descriptors are useful for implementing computed attributes, type checking, or access control.

    Example:
    ```python
    class TypedProperty:
        def __init__(self, name, type_):
            self.name = name
            self.type = type_

        def __get__(self, obj, cls):
            if obj is None:
                return self
            return getattr(obj, f"_{self.name}")

        def __set__(self, obj, value):
            if not isinstance(value, self.type):
                raise TypeError(f"Expected {self.type}")
            setattr(obj, f"_{self.name}", value)

    class Person:
        name = TypedProperty("name", str)
        age = TypedProperty("age", int)

    p = Person()
    p.name = "Alice"  # OK
    p.age = 30        # OK
    p.age = "30"      # Raises TypeError
    ```

These additional questions and answers cover more Python concepts, including some nuanced aspects of the language. They touch on topics like context managers, magic methods, concurrency, advanced decorators, and descriptors, which are important for a deeper understanding of Python.

What is the use of self in a class?

self represents the instance of the class and allows access to its attributes and methods.
What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?

A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the original objects.
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.
Intermediate Python Interview Questions
What is a lambda function in Python?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the keyword lambda. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression.
What is a generator in Python?

A generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, rather than computing the entire series upfront.
What are list comprehensions? Give an example.

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Example:
[x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

What is the global keyword in Python?

global is used to declare that a variable inside a function refers to a globally scoped variable, not a local one.

What is the difference between __init__ and __new__ in Python?

__init__ initializes an already created instance of a class.
__new__ is responsible for creating a new instance of the class.

What is a closure in Python?

A closure is a nested function that remembers the environment in which it was created, even after the outer function has finished execution.

Explain how Python’s with statement works.

The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common setup and cleanup actions in a context manager (e.g., managing file resources).

What is *args and **kwargs in function definitions?

*args allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function.
**kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.

What is the @staticmethod decorator?

@staticmethod defines a method that does not require access to the instance or class attributes. It acts like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.

What is monkey patching in Python?

Monkey patching refers to modifying or extending code at runtime without altering the original source code.

Advanced Python Interview Questions
Explain Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously, even on multi-core processors. It can hinder multi-threaded programs' performance.
What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing in Python?

Multithreading involves running multiple threads (lighter-weight, shared memory space) in a single process.
Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space, which bypasses the GIL limitation.
How does Python manage memory for large objects?

Python has an object allocator that manages large objects in memory by delegating memory requests for large blocks to the system allocator.
What is metaprogramming in Python?

Metaprogramming involves writing programs that manipulate other programs or themselves at runtime, typically using metaclasses or decorators.
What are descriptors in Python?

Descriptors are objects that define how attribute access is interpreted by the interpreter. They implement methods like __get__, __set__, and __delete__.
What are coroutines, and how do they differ from generators?

Coroutines are similar to generators, but they are designed to consume values as well as produce them. They are typically used for asynchronous programming.
How do you handle memory leaks in Python?

You can use tools like gc (garbage collector) module, objgraph, or tracemalloc to track down memory leaks in Python.
What is the purpose of the __slots__ keyword?

__slots__ is used to limit the attributes that an instance of a class can have, thus reducing memory overhead and improving performance.
How do you implement thread synchronization in Python?

Thread synchronization is implemented using mechanisms like threading.Lock(), threading.RLock(), threading.Semaphore(), and threading.Condition().
What are asyncio tasks in Python?

asyncio provides a framework for asynchronous programming, and tasks are used to run coroutines concurrently, allowing you to write non-blocking code.

More Basic Python Interview Questions
What is the difference between remove(), pop(), and del in lists?

remove(x) removes the first occurrence of x in the list.
pop(index) removes and returns the element at the given index (if no index is provided, it removes the last element).
del list[index] deletes the element at the given index but does not return it.


What are modules and packages in Python?

A module is a single file of Python code that can be imported (e.g., math, os).
A package is a collection of modules organized in directories, containing an __init__.py file.

What is the difference between append() and extend() methods in Python?

append() adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list.
extend() adds each element of the argument (which must be iterable) to the list.

What is the difference between local, global, and nonlocal variables?

Local: Declared inside a function and accessible only within it.
Global: Declared outside any function and accessible throughout the script.
Nonlocal: Declared inside a nested function, it refers to variables in the nearest enclosing scope.

What is the purpose of the pass statement in Python?

The pass statement is a placeholder used when a statement is required syntactically but you don’t want any action. It’s used to define empty blocks of code.

What are Python iterators and iterables?

An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time (e.g., lists, tuples).
An iterator is an object that produces the next value in a sequence when the next() function is called. It is obtained using the iter() function.

What is the difference between range() and xrange()?

In Python 3.x, xrange() was replaced by range(), which now behaves like xrange() in Python 2.x, generating values lazily (i.e., without creating a full list in memory).

Explain how exception handling works in Python.

Python uses try-except blocks to handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block catches and handles it.
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except SomeError:
    # Code to handle the exception

What is the map() function in Python?

map() applies a given function to all items in an input iterable and returns a map object (which is an iterator).
list(map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]


What is the purpose of the join() method in Python?

The join() method concatenates the elements of an iterable (usually a list or tuple) into a single string with a specified separator.

','.join(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
# Output: 'apple,banana,cherry'


Explain method resolution order (MRO) in Python.

MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to maintain the method search order.
The MRO can be checked using the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method of a class.

class A: pass
class B(A): pass
print(B.mro())
# Output: [<class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]

What is a metaclass in Python?

A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. In other words, a metaclass controls the creation of classes and their behavior.
The default metaclass is type, but custom metaclasses can be created by overriding __new__() and __init__().

What are *args and **kwargs, and how are they useful?

*args allows you to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function.
**kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.
def example(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)
example(1, 2, 3, key='value')
# Output: (1, 2, 3) {'key': 'value'}

Explain the difference between deepcopy() and copy() in Python.

copy() creates a shallow copy, meaning it only copies the outermost object but not nested objects (changes in nested objects affect the copy).
deepcopy() creates a full copy, recursively copying all objects (changes in the original will not affect the copy).

What is the yield keyword in Python, and how is it used?

yield is used in place of return inside a function to return a generator object. It allows a function to return multiple values lazily, pausing its state between executions.

def count():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i
gen = count()
next(gen)  # Output: 0

What is duck typing in Python?

Duck typing refers to Python’s dynamic type system where an object's behavior (methods and properties) determines its usability, rather than its actual type.
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."

class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack")

def make_it_quack(duck):
    duck.quack()

What is the purpose of __name__ == "__main__" in Python?

It allows you to check whether a Python script is being run directly or being imported as a module. If run directly, the code block inside this check will execute.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This script is being run directly")

How does Python's property() function work?

The property() function in Python is used to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, making them behave like properties while maintaining encapsulation.
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius
    
    def get_radius(self):
        return self._radius
    
    def set_radius(self, value):
        self._radius = value
    
    radius = property(get_radius, set_radius)

Explain what happens during the Python object lifecycle (creation and destruction).

The lifecycle of an object starts with memory allocation (via __new__) and initialization (via __init__). The object is then used and eventually garbage-collected when no references to it remain. Final cleanup occurs via the __del__ method if defined.

What is the functools.lru_cache decorator in Python?

The lru_cache decorator is used to cache the results of expensive or I/O-bound functions to improve performance. It stores the results of recent function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again.
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def expensive_function(x):
    return x**2

ntermediate Questions
Explain the concept of decorators in Python. Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function or method. They are often used for logging, access control, and instrumentation.

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)? GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once.
It simplifies memory management but can limit the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded programs.

How do you handle exceptions in Python? Use try, except, else, and finally blocks.
try:
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
else:
    print("Division successful")
finally:
    print("This always executes")

try:
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
else:
    print("Division successful")
finally:
    print("This always executes")

What is the difference between append() and extend() methods in lists? append() adds a single element to the end of the list. extend() adds all elements of an iterable (like another list) to the end of the list.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # my_list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.extend([5, 6])  # my_list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


Describe the use of __init__ and __del__ methods. __init__ initializes an object when it is created. __del__ is called when an object is about to be destroyed.
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        print(f'{self.name} created.')

    def __del__(self):
        print(f'{self.name} destroyed.')

Advanced Questions
What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__ methods? __str__ is for creating a readable string representation of an object, intended for end users. __repr__ is for creating a detailed string representation of an object, aimed at developers.
class MyClass:
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'MyClass()'
    
    def __str__(self):
        return 'Instance of MyClass'

Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python. Metaclasses are classes of classes that define how classes behave. A class is an instance of a metaclass.
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print("Creating class", name)
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

How do you implement a singleton design pattern in Python? By ensuring a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to it.
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

What is the purpose of the yield keyword? yield is used to turn a function into a generator, which can return multiple values one at a time, suspending and resuming their state between each call.
def generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

Describe the process of monkey patching in Python. Monkey patching refers to modifying or extending code at runtime, often by altering existing classes or modules.
import some_module

def patched_method():
    print("This is a patched method")

some_module.original_method = patched_method

What is a Python dictionary? A dictionary is an unordered collection of items, with key-value pairs. The keys must be unique and immutable.
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

How do you reverse a list in Python? Using the reverse() method or slicing.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.reverse()  # [4, 3, 2, 1]

reversed_list = my_list[::-1]  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

What is a lambda function? A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # 5

**What are *args and kwargs? They allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments.
def my_func(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)
my_func(1, 2, a=3, b=4)

Advanced Questions
What is a generator in Python? A generator is a special type of iterator that yields items one at a time using the yield keyword.
def gen_func():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

How does garbage collection work in Python? Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory. 
Objects are deallocated when their reference count drops to zero.

What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. 
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.

import copy
original = [1, [2, 3], 4]
shallow = copy.copy(original)
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

What are Python's built-in types that are immutable? Some immutable built-in types in Python are:

int

float

bool

str

tuple

frozenset

Explain Python's context manager and the with statement. Context managers allow setup and cleanup actions around a block of code, using __enter__ and __exit__ methods.
The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common try/except/finally patterns.
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

Generators are functions that return an iterator, allowing you to iterate over a sequence of values one at a time. They use the yield keyword to return values.

def my_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i

for num in my_generator():
    print(num)

Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python.

Metaclasses are classes that are used to create other classes. They allow you to customize the behavior of class creation.
